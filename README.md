# Spring Dynamo Demo
This example serves as a demo for implementing the Spring Data Dynamo library to make
working with Dynamo DB in a Spring Boot application a little easier. Deployment is
done with Serverless framework to AWS, but there there is also a local configuration
for running DynamoDB locally.
